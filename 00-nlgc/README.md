# Network Localized Granger Causality (NLGC)

A statistical framework known as Network Localized Granger Causality (NLGC) is utilized to identify causal relationships at the cortical level using data from magnetoencephalography (MEG)..

# How to Run
First change your current working directory to the `src` directory, run the following code to add `src` to your `PYTHONPATH`:
```
export PYTHONPATH=${PWD}
```
then run :
```
python src/main.py
```
